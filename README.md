## Project Overview
Modern smart home solutions often sacrifice usability for functionality, leaving users—especially the elderly and people with special needs—struggling with complex interfaces. Our **Smart Home App** addresses this gap with an intuitive, accessible design that empowers all users to effortlessly control lighting, temperature, security, and more.

## Problem Statement
- **Usability challenges** in existing apps: cluttered layouts, hidden features, insufficient guidance.
- **Accessibility gaps**: limited voice control, poor customization for diverse user needs.
- **Inefficient energy management**: users cannot easily monitor or automate device usage.

## Proposed Solution
- **Voice and touch control:** Integrates voice commands (Google Home / Alexa) alongside a simple touch interface.
- **Customizable alerts:** Clear, actionable notifications for security events, device failures, and maintenance reminders.
- **Energy efficiency features:** Real-time power usage display and scheduling tools to automate routines.
- **Inclusive design:** Large icons, consistent labeling, and adaptive layouts for varied user profiles.

## Prototypes
- **Prototype 1.0:** Core screens – Home Dashboard, Room Control, Device Panel, Room Addition, Settings, Alerts.
- **Prototype 1.1:** Enhanced with Scheduling and Voice Command management screens based on initial usability feedback.

### Key Screens
1. **Home Dashboard:** Overview of rooms and quick-access controls.  
2. **Room Control Panel:** Adjust lighting, temperature, and devices per room.  
3. **Device Panel (e.g., Amazon Echo):** Monitor and control specific smart devices.  
4. **Add Room:** Guided form with dropdowns and validation to avoid errors.  
5. **Schedule Light:** Set automatic on/off times.  
6. **Voice Commands:** View, add, and preview custom voice actions.  
7. **Alerts:** Timestamped notifications with “Mark as Read” options.

## Evaluation Plan
- **Participants:** 6 users (mixed ages 17–49) performed tasks in a within-group design.  
- **Tasks:** Add room, review alerts, adjust lighting, use voice commands, integrate devices.  
- **Metrics:** Task success rate, time on task, error rate, click count, and subjective satisfaction.  
- **Results:** Identified critical issues (unclear alerts), major issues (notification overload), and minor issues (unlabeled icons).

## Recommendations
1. **Actionable Alerts:** Include direct buttons (e.g., “Secure Now”) to guide user response.  
2. **Notification Filters:** Allow users to prioritize or group alerts to reduce noise.  
3. **Icon Labeling:** Add tooltips or text labels for all icons to improve recognition.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Design & Prototyping:** Figma Community (multiple UI kits)  
- **Usability Testing:** Facilitator scripts, consent forms, post-test questionnaires  
- **Documentation:** Microsoft Word (Final Report)

## How to Explore
1. **View Prototypes:** Open Figma links provided in the report appendix.  
2. **Run Usability Scripts:** See `Appendix` for consent form and facilitator script.  
3. **Review Findings:** Read the Final Report (PDF) for detailed analysis and recommendations.
